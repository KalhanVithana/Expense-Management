## üíª Frontend Architecture

### üß± Atomic Design with Next.js

The frontend is built with **Next.js**, following the **Atomic Design architecture**, which divides the UI into reusable building blocks: Atoms, Molecules, Organisms, Templates, and Pages.

- **Tech Stack:**
  - Next.js (React Framework)
  - Ant Design (UI library)
  - Redux Toolkit (state management)
  - Tailwind CSS (latest version)
  - React Query / TanStack Query (for data fetching & caching)

### ‚úÖ Benefits

- **Atomic Design:**
  - Reusability and consistency across UI components
  - Clear folder and component structure
- **Next.js:**
  - Fast rendering with **Static Site Generation (SSG)** for SEO and performance
  - Hybrid rendering support (SSG + SSR)
- **Ant Design:**
  - Pre-built UI components for rapid development
- **Redux Toolkit:**
  - Simplified and optimized state management with modern Redux practices
  - Type-safe and maintainable
- **Tailwind CSS (Latest):**
  - Utility-first styling with better DX and full customization
- **TanStack Query:**
  - Powerful data fetching, caching, and automatic refetching
 
## üì¶ Backend Architecture

### ‚öôÔ∏è Microservices with Serverless Express

The backend uses a **microservices architecture** deployed as a **mono-lambda** using **serverless Express** and **MongoDB**.

- **Tech Stack:**
  - Node.js + Express.js
  - Serverless deployment (AWS Lambda, Vercel)
  - MongoDB

### ‚úÖ Benefits

- Scalable and cost-efficient
- Isolated microservice boundaries
- Simple CI/CD pipelines
- Stateless deployment
